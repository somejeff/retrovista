# Retro Vista

Synchronized display of imagery across multiple digital photo frames


## About Retro Vista

Retro Vista is all about bringing people together through a shared love for memories. The goal is to provide a platform that allows users to upload their cherished photos, enabling them to be displayed contemporaneously on digital photo frames. Imagine a world where your most treasured moments are showcased in a harmonious blend of past and present.

## Approach

Users configure a client to connect to a shared online gallery.  The server side selects the photos to be contemporaneously displayed on all the clients in the same group.
